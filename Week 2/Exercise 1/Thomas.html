            Thomas J. Watson, Jr., was chairman and chief executive officer during IBM's most explosive period of growth. He led the company from the age of mechanical tabulators and typewriters into the computer era. During his leadership, IBM grew from a medium-sized business to one of the dozen largest industrial corporations in the world. Watson was a pioneer in the development of accounting and computing equipment used today by business, government, science and industry. He built a worldwide industry during his 42 years at IBM. Mr. Watson was born in Campbell, N.Y., February 17, 1874.
