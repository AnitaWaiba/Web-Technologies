    Table tennis, also called Ping-Pong, ball game similar in principle to lawn tennis 
    and played on a flat table divided into two equal courts by a net fixed across its 
    width at the middle. The object is to hit the ball so that it goes over the net and 
    bounces on the opponentâ€™s half of the table in such a way that the opponent cannot 
    reach it or return it correctly.

    The lightweight hollow ball is propelled back 
    and forth across the net by small rackets (bats, or paddles) held by the players. The 
    game is popular all over the world. In most countries it is very highly organized as a 
    competitive sport, especially in Europe and Asia, particularly in China and Japan.
